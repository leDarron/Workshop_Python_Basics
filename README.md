# Workshop: The basics of python 


Python is an interpreted, cross-paradigm, cross-platform programming language. It promotes structured, functional and object-oriented imperative programming. 


 # Part 1 : Introduction
 
   ## Task 00 -HelloWord :
    Let's start with a good old “Hello world” program, first of all, create a new file callde ‘hello_world.py’.
    To print something on the console you just need to call the print() function. 
    When you are done writing your code, launch your programm using python3:

   ## Task 01 -Variables :
    In python, variables are non-typed, you can asign any value of any type to any variables.
    You can also change the type of a variable as you wish. 
    The print() function takes as many parameters as you want of the type you want.
    You should try create some variables and print them

   ## Task 02 -Tupples :
      Tuples are used to store multiple items in a single variable. You can put as many item as you want in a tuple.

     Try to get your tupple's values and print them.

   ## Task 03 -list :
      Just as tuples, lists are used to store multiple items in a single variable, but it allow you to add and remove items. 
      To add or remove items of your list, use the function append() and remove().
      Try to get your list and print them.

   ## Task 04 -Dictionaries :
     A dictionary is a collection of key-value pairs, it allows you to bind a value to a key. 
     Here is the syntax:
